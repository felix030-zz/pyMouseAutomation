PyObjC is a bridge between Python and Objective-C.  It allows full
featured Cocoa applications to be written in pure Python.  It is also
easy to use other frameworks containing Objective-C class libraries
from Python and to mix in Objective-C, C and C++ source.

This package is a pseudo-package that will install all pyobjc related
packages (that is, pyobjc-core as well as wrapppers for frameworks on
OSX)
