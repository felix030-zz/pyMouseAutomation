PyObjC is a bridge between Python and Objective-C.  It allows full
featured Cocoa applications to be written in pure Python.  It is also
easy to use other frameworks containing Objective-C class libraries
from Python and to mix in Objective-C, C and C++ source.

Python is a highly dynamic programming language with a shallow learning
curve.  It combines remarkable power with very clear syntax.

The installer package installs a number of Xcode templates for
easily creating new Cocoa-Python projects.

PyObjC also supports full introspection of Objective-C classes and
direct invocation of Objective-C APIs from the interactive interpreter.
