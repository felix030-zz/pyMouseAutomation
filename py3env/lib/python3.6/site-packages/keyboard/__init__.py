keyboard
========

Take full control of your keyboard with this small Python library. Hook global events, register hotkeys, simulate key presses and much more.

## Features

- Global event hook on all keyboards (captures keys regardless of focus).
- **Listen** and **sends** keyboard events.
- Works with **Windows** and **Linux** (requires sudo), with experimental **OS X** support (thanks @glitchassassin!).
- **Pure Python**, no C modules to be compiled.
- **Zero dependencies**. Trivial to install and deploy, just copy the files.
- **Python 2 and 3**.
- Complex hotkey support (e.g. `Ctrl+Shift+M, Ctrl+Space`) with controllable timeout.
- Includes **high level API** (e.g. [record](#keyboard.record) and [play](#keyboard.play), [add_abbreviation](#keyboard.add_abbreviation)).
- Maps keys as they actually are in your layout, with **full internationalization support** (e.g. `Ctrl+รง`).
- Events automatically captured in separate thread, doesn't block main program.
- Tested and documented.
- Doesn't break accented dead keys (I'm looking at you, pyHook).
- Mouse support available via project [mouse](https://github.com/boppreh/mouse) (`pip install mouse`).

This program makes no attempt to hide itself, so don't use it for keyloggers.

## Usage

Install the [PyPI package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/keyboard/):

    $ sudo pip install keyboard

or clone the repository (no installation required, source files are sufficient):

    $ git clone https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard

Then check the [API docs](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard#api) to see what features are available.


## Example


```
import keyboard

keyboard.press_and_release('shift+s, space')

keyboard.write('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.')

# Press PAGE UP then PAGE DOWN to type "foobar".
keyboard.add_hotkey('page up, page down', lambda: keyboard.write('foobar'))

# Blocks until you press esc.
keyboard.wait('esc')

# Record events until 'esc' is pressed.
recorded = keyboard.record(until='esc')
# Then replay back at three times the speed.
keyboard.play(recorded, speed_factor=3)

# Type @@ then press space to replace with abbreviation.
keyboard.add_abbreviation('@@', 'my.long.email@example.com')
# Block forever.
keyboard.wait()
```

## Known limitations:

- Events generated under Windows don't report device id (`event.device == None`). [#21](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard/issues/21)
- Linux doesn't seem to report media keys. [#20](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard/issues/20)
- Currently no way to suppress keys ('catch' events and block them). [#22](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard/issues/22)
- To avoid depending on X the Linux parts reads raw device files (`/dev/input/input*`)
but this requries root.
- Other applications, such as some games, may register hooks that swallow all 
key events. In this case `keyboard` will be unable to report events.
